= A Demo for Linkerd 2

== Installing Linkerd 2 In China

Linkerd's images are in grc.io, so I made mirror repository myself.

Every time this repository is pushed, Linkerd 2's images are copied to hub.docker.com through Travis CI.

This is from link:.travis.yml[]:

```
./cp-images.sh linkerd2/images.properties
```

Linkerd's version is in link:linkerd2/images.properties[].

Before Installing Linkerd 2, you need pull images.

```
./pull-images.sh linkerd2/images.properties
```

Then following https://linkerd.io/2/getting-started/ and `cp ~/.linkerd2/bin/linkerd /usr/local/bin/`
